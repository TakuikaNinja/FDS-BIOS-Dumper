# FDS BIOS Dumper

This program dumps the FDS BIOS ROM (8KiB) onto a disk.
Now you can legally obtain a dump from original hardware!

## Usage

Simply boot the program (from a real disk or a drive emulator) and it will automatically dump the BIOS onto a disk.
Should any issues occur, an error message/code will be displayed.

## Building

The CC65 toolchain is required to build the program: https://cc65.github.io/
A simple `make` should then work.

The NESdev Wiki, Forums, and Discord have been a massive help. 
Kudos to everyone keeping this console generation alive!
